[4141. Count Elements With at Least K Greater Values](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-elements-with-at-least-k-greater-values)

Medium

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`.

An element in `nums` is said to be **qualified** if there exist **at least** `k` elements in the array that are **strictly greater** than it.

Return an integer denoting the total number of qualified elements in `nums`.

 

Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [3,1,2], k = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The elements 1 and 2 each have at least `k = 1` element greater than themselves.
​​​​​​​No element is greater than 3. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [5,5,5], k = 2

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

Since all elements are equal to 5, no element is greater than the other. Therefore, the answer is 0.

 

**Constraints:**

	* `1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5`
	* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
	* `0 <= k < n`
