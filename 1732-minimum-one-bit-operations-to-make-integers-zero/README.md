[1732. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero)

Hard

Given an integer `n`, you must transform it into `0` using the following operations any number of times:

	* Change the rightmost (`0^th`) bit in the binary representation of `n`.
	* Change the `i^th` bit in the binary representation of `n` if the `(i-1)^th` bit is set to `1` and the `(i-2)^th` through `0^th` bits are set to `0`.

Return the minimum number of operations to transform `n` into `0`.

 

Example 1:

```

Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
"11" -> "01" with the 2^nd operation since the 0^th bit is 1.
"01" -> "00" with the 1^st operation.

```

Example 2:

```

Input: n = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
"110" -> "010" with the 2^nd operation since the 1^st bit is 1 and 0^th through 0^th bits are 0.
"010" -> "011" with the 1^st operation.
"011" -> "001" with the 2^nd operation since the 0^th bit is 1.
"001" -> "000" with the 1^st operation.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	* `0 <= n <= 10^9`
